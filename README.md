# JJK RESTAURANT OPERATIONS - PART 2

## Overview
This project is an implementation of data structures to simulate restaurant operations for two restaurant owners, Gojo and Sukuna. It is part of the Data Structures and Algorithms course at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT).

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, students will:
- Implement tree-based data structures and hash tables.
- Choose appropriate data structures to optimize performance and meet the project requirements.

## Project Description
The story revolves around Gojo and Sukuna managing their own restaurants before they decided to merge. The program will handle various customer-related operations using specified commands.

## Requirements
- Use the provided `initial.zip` which contains `main.cpp`, `main.h`, `restaurant.cpp`, and `test.txt`.
- Modify only `restaurant.cpp` to implement the required functionalities.
- Ensure only `#include "main.h"` is used in `restaurant.cpp`.
- The program should properly handle memory allocation and deallocation.

## Academic Integrity
- All code must be written individually.
- Any suspicious similarity between submissions will be considered plagiarism.
- Students must be able to explain their own code when asked.

## Compilation and Execution
The project will be compiled and tested using:
```
g++ (MinGW-W64 i686-ucrt-posix-dwarf) 11.2.0
```
Ensure that the code runs successfully under this environment.
